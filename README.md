# 04LibraryApi

This is the backend service for a project I'm working on, "04Library", built with ASP.NET Core 9 Web API and Microsoft SQL Server as the database. It implements JWT-based authentication and authorization for secure user access, and follows REST API best practices.


## Features
- Librarians can manage the books available in the library.
- Users can:
    - View available books.
    - Add books to their personal library
    - Mark books as finished or not.
